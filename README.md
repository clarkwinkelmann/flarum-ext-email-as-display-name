This extension offers two features:

- Use user emails as their "display name" in Flarum.
  - Permission to see for own user
  - Permission to see for all users (be careful with this one)
- Removes usernames from login and sign up forms. New users are assigned a random string as username.
  - Must be enabled in the settings modal
