This extension offers two features:

- Use user emails as their "display name" in Flarum.
  - Permission to see for own user
  - Permission to see for all users (be careful with this one)
- Removes usernames from login and sign up forms. New users are assigned a random string as username.
  - Must be enabled in the settings modal

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-email-as-display-name

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
